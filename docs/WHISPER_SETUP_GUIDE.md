# Whisper Voice-to-Text Setup Guide for Beginners

## What You're Building

You're creating a "smart container" that can listen to audio files and convert speech to text. Think of it like having a really good translator that lives in a box on your computer, and your phone app can send voice recordings to this box to get text back.

## How It Works (The Big Picture)

```
Your Phone (Expo App) → Sends Audio → Docker Container (Whisper AI) → Sends Back Text
```

1. **Your Phone**: Records voice using the React Native app
2. **Your Computer**: Runs a Docker container with Whisper AI
3. **The Magic**: Container receives audio, processes it with AI, sends back text
4. **Same Network**: Phone and computer talk to each other over WiFi

## What is Docker? (Simple Explanation)

Think of Docker like a **shipping container** for software:

- **Regular Container**: Holds physical items, can be moved between ships/trucks
- **Docker Container**: Holds software and everything it needs, can run on any computer

**Why Use Docker?**
- **Consistency**: Works the same on everyone's computer
- **Easy Sharing**: Other developers can run the exact same setup
- **No Conflicts**: Doesn't mess with other software on your computer
- **Easy Cleanup**: Delete container = everything gone, no leftover files

## Prerequisites (What You Need)

### On Your Computer:
1. **Docker Desktop** - Download from docker.com
2. **Basic Terminal/Command Prompt** knowledge
3. **Text Editor** (VS Code recommended)

### Network Setup:
- Phone and computer on **same WiFi network**
- No VPN running (can block connections)
- Firewall might need adjustment (we'll cover this)

## Step 1: Install Docker Desktop

### Download and Install:
1. Go to https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
2. Download for your operating system (Windows/Mac/Linux)
3. Install with default settings
4. **Important**: Restart your computer after installation

### Verify Installation:
1. Open Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows)
2. Type: `docker --version`
3. You should see something like "Docker version 20.x.x"
4. Type: `docker run hello-world`
5. If you see "Hello from Docker!" - you're ready!

## Step 2: Understanding the Whisper Service

### What is Whisper?
- **Made by OpenAI** (same company as ChatGPT)
- **AI Model** that converts speech to text
- **Supports 90+ languages** including Arabic, English, etc.
- **Runs offline** - no internet needed after download

### How Our Service Works:
1. **Flask Web Server**: Receives audio files from your phone
2. **Whisper AI**: Processes the audio and extracts text
3. **API Endpoint**: Sends text back to your phone app

## Step 3: Create the Whisper Service Files

### File Structure You'll Create:
```
medical-diagnosis-tool/
├── whisper-service/
│   ├── Dockerfile          # Instructions to build container
│   ├── app.py             # Python web server code
│   └── requirements.txt   # Python packages needed
└── docker-compose.yml     # Easy way to run everything
```

### What Each File Does:

**Dockerfile**: 
- Like a recipe for building your container
- Tells Docker: "Install Python, install Whisper, copy my code, start the server"

**app.py**: 
- The actual web server that receives audio and returns text
- Has endpoints like `/transcribe` that your phone app calls

**requirements.txt**: 
- List of Python packages needed (like ingredients list)

**docker-compose.yml**: 
- Easy way to start/stop all services
- Like a "start everything" button

## Step 4: Build Your Container

### The Build Process:
1. **Navigate to project folder** in terminal
2. **Run build command**: `docker-compose build`
3. **What happens behind the scenes**:
   - Docker downloads Python
   - Installs Whisper AI (this is big - 1GB+)
   - Copies your code into container
   - Sets up the web server

### First Build Takes Time:
- **15-30 minutes** depending on internet speed
- Downloads large AI model files
- Only happens once - subsequent builds are fast

## Step 5: Run Your Service

### Starting the Service:
1. **Command**: `docker-compose up`
2. **What you'll see**:
   - Container starting up
   - Whisper model loading
   - Web server starting on port 5000
   - "Ready to accept requests" message

### Testing It Works:
1. **Open browser** and go to: `http://localhost:5000/health`
2. **Should see**: `{"status": "healthy"}`
3. **This means**: Your service is running and ready

## Step 6: Connect Your Phone App

### Find Your Computer's IP Address:

**Windows**:
1. Open Command Prompt
2. Type: `ipconfig`
3. Look for "IPv4 Address" under your WiFi adapter
4. Example: `192.168.1.100`

**Mac**:
1. Open Terminal
2. Type: `ifconfig | grep inet`
3. Look for address starting with 192.168 or 10.0
4. Example: `192.168.1.100`

### Update Your App:
- In your React Native app, change the API endpoint
- Instead of `localhost:5000`, use `192.168.1.100:5000`
- Now your phone can talk to your computer

## Step 7: Test the Full Workflow

### Testing Steps:
1. **Start Docker service** on computer
2. **Open Expo app** on phone
3. **Record voice** in the app
4. **Check computer terminal** - you should see API requests
5. **Check phone** - should receive transcribed text

### What Success Looks Like:
- Computer terminal shows: "POST /transcribe - 200 OK"
- Phone app displays the transcribed text
- No error messages

## Step 8: Package for Other Developers

### Why Packaging Matters:
- Other team members need the same setup
- Should work on their computers without hassle
- No "works on my machine" problems

### How Docker Solves This:

**Option 1: Share Docker Compose File**
- Other developers run: `docker-compose up`
- Docker automatically builds everything
- Same environment on every computer

**Option 2: Pre-built Image (Advanced)**
- Build once, share the built container
- Others download and run immediately
- Faster for team members

### For Your Team:
1. **Commit all Docker files** to Git repository
2. **Team members clone** the repository
3. **They run**: `docker-compose up`
4. **Everything works** the same way

## Step 9: Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Can't Connect" Errors:
- **Check WiFi**: Phone and computer same network?
- **Check Firewall**: Windows/Mac firewall blocking port 5000?
- **Check IP Address**: Using correct computer IP in phone app?

### "Container Won't Start":
- **Check Docker**: Is Docker Desktop running?
- **Check Ports**: Is port 5000 already used by something else?
- **Check Logs**: Run `docker-compose logs` to see error messages

### "Transcription Takes Forever":
- **First time is slow**: Whisper model loading
- **Subsequent requests**: Should be much faster
- **Large audio files**: Take longer to process

### "Out of Memory" Errors:
- **Whisper needs RAM**: At least 4GB recommended
- **Close other apps**: Free up memory
- **Use smaller model**: Change from "large" to "base" model

## Step 10: Advanced Tips

### Making It Faster:
- **Use smaller Whisper model**: "tiny" or "base" instead of "large"
- **More RAM**: Helps with processing speed
- **SSD Storage**: Faster than traditional hard drives

### Making It More Reliable:
- **Health checks**: Container restarts if it crashes
- **Logging**: Save transcription logs for debugging
- **Error handling**: Graceful failures instead of crashes

### Scaling for Team:
- **Shared server**: One computer runs service for whole team
- **Multiple instances**: Run multiple containers for speed
- **Load balancing**: Distribute requests across containers

## Understanding the Technology Stack

### The Complete Flow:
1. **React Native App** (JavaScript) - User interface
2. **HTTP Request** (Network) - Sends audio file
3. **Flask Server** (Python) - Receives and handles requests
4. **Whisper AI** (Machine Learning) - Converts speech to text
5. **HTTP Response** (Network) - Sends text back
6. **React Native App** (JavaScript) - Displays result

### Why This Architecture:
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI separate from AI processing
- **Scalability**: Can handle multiple requests
- **Flexibility**: Easy to swap different AI models
- **Team Work**: Frontend and backend developers can work independently

## Next Steps After Setup

### For You (Hamza):
1. **Get basic service running** first
2. **Test with simple audio files**
3. **Integrate with team's React Native app**
4. **Help teammates set up their own instances**

### For Your Team:
1. **Frontend team** updates app to call your service
2. **Test together** with real voice recordings
3. **Handle edge cases** (no internet, service down, etc.)
4. **Prepare demo scenarios** with different languages/accents

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Docker container starts without errors
- ✅ Health check endpoint returns "healthy"
- ✅ Phone app can send audio to your computer
- ✅ Transcribed text appears in phone app
